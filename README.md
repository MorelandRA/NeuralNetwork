# NeuralNetwork
A neural network designed in Java

My second version of a self-constructing neural network. So far, the neural network version of the project is complete, as well as saving and loading data and neural nets.
In the future, I intend on implementing the NEAT algorithm.

To view a demo of the project, run the Demo.java class and view the console. It shows how the neural network performs on several basic data sets. In the future, I also plan
to include more data sets with more complex data. For now, the data serves the purpose of confirming that the project is functioning correctly.

In order for the demo to be successful, you will need to download iris.data from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/
and save it under the working directory as "Iris.csv".
